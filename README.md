## The Haskell CI Group

This group meets monthly to discuss relevant current events. Anyone who operates
in the intersection of Haskell and CI is welcome to attend meetings and join the
discussion. Contact bryan@haskell.foundation for an invite!

Want to help develop the group itself? PRs to this repo are also welcome!
