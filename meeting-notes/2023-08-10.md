# Haskell CI Group Notes

* **Thursday, August 10 2023**
* **Combined notes from two meetings**

## Discussion summary

* Introductions
* Free form discussion

## Discussion topics
Some topics came up a lot:

* Nix
* Haskell fragility
* Repository automation

### Nix

* Everybody on both calls uses Nix.
* [haskell.nix] was originally created to cross-compile for Windows. (Building Haskell on Windows is challenging.)
    * "A lot of haskell.nix [features] should be in GHC and Cabal...."
* A few people use Hydra for Nix builds, though not without misgivings.
* [GitHub Actionsâ€“Hydra integration][gh-hydra] was mentioned.
* Cabal is a spec, but one that hasn't been implemented in Nix.

### Haskell fragility

* The fact that the same project can't be built with GHC $x$ and GHC $x+1$ simultaneously (due to breaking changes in GHC, base libraries, or both) came up as a big challenge for doing early testing of new GHC releases.
* Haskell (and Cabal) are both very expressive, which leads to fragility.
* Everyone depends on the Cabal library to do Haskell dependency management. Where it isn't available (e.g. Nixpkgs), solutions aren't very robust.

### Repository automation

* We agreed some kind of automation for dependency management would be nice.
* Someone mentioned that the recent tool [haskell-bounds-bump-action](https://github.com/nomeata/haskell-bounds-bump-action) may fill the niche for some.
